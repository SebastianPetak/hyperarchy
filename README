RunLater
========

Simply a blatant port of Merb's run_later method, taking advantage of Rails 2.2 thread safety.
Runs longer running tasks outside the current request thread, so that the request will return
the content to the user without blocking. Once the request is done, the worker will run the 
specified block in a separate thread.

It's merely a proof-of-concept for now, and my entry into the thread-safe Rails world, so I can't
guarantee anything about the code.

Example
=======

class AccountController < ApplicationController
  def signup
    @user = User.new(params[:user])
    if @user.save
      run_later do
        AccountMailer.deliver_signup(@user)
      end
    end
  end
end

Thanks to Yehuda Katz for showing off run_later at the Merb BoF session at RailsConf Europe 2008.
