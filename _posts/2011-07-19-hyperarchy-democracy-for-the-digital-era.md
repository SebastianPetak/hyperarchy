**If Thomas Jefferson and James Madison lived in the 21st century instead of the 18th, what sort of government would they have designed?** It took over a week for news to travel from Monticello to Philadelphia by horse; now it flashes around the world in seconds via Twitter. Yet our government still runs on essentially the same horse-drawn design. If we look with fresh eyes and discard analog assumptions, what kind of democracy can we build for the digital era?

Hyperarchy is our attempt to answer that question. **Hyperâ€¢archy** literally means non-sequentially linked government. In a *hierarchy*, power flows upward through a rigid, slowly-changing structure. It's the Washington elite, debating the fate of millions on the Senate floor. In a *hyperarchy*, by contrast, power flows through a complex network of personal relationships, continually pooling and dispersing in an ever-shifting landscape of trust and influence. Like an operating system for democracy, Hyperarchy strips away the formality and  procedure we normally associate with government, relying instead on software to give structure and meaning to organic human conversation.

### Structuring the Conversation

</div>

Good software augments and organizes human interaction; it never replaces it. Using Hyperarchy is simple. It provides *just enough* structure to the conversation so that conclusions can be drawn, but doesn't weigh you down with a lot of steps and mechanisms.

You start by raising a question, like "How should we balance the federal budget?" Then you or anyone else suggests answers to that question. When you see an answer you like, you can drag it to rank it above or below other answers. As you and others vote by dragging answers, Hyperarchy uses a [sophisticated algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_pairs) to compute a collective ranking of all answers that fairly reflects everyone's opinions. Everything updates in real time, so you can quickly see where the group stands, or drill into other people's rankings to see what they think individually.  [Try it for yourself](https://hyperarchy.com/questions/394) to see how easy it is.

### Building the Network of Trust

Even as simple as Hyperarchy makes voting, no one has time to contribute to every question. So Hyperarchy recasts *representative democracy* as *networked democracy*. Instead of electing a Senator you've never met to represent you on everything, you elect individuals you trust personally to represent you on specific issues. I can give my girlfriend power to vote on my behalf for questions about *health* and *nutrition*, while delegating to my coworker for questions concerning *programming languages* or *digital privacy*. So when my girlfriend votes about health or my coworker votes on technology, they vote for me as well.

But the real power is when influence flows through multiple connections in the social network. My girlfriend might delegate *nutrition* to her friend David, who in turn delegates to Michael Pollan. So Michael Pollan might become an emergent super-representative, voting on behalf on hundreds or thousands of followers, all because of individual trust relationships. And you can change your delegation at any time, meaning that people hold power only so long as they deserve it.

### Hyperarchy's Present & Future

People have used Hyperarchy (in various states of completion) for the past 8 months. Pivotal Labs, Grockit, and MessageBus have all used it to set the agenda for meetings and gather quick feedback from their teams. We're launching our social version of the product, with Facebook and Twitter integration, this week. A high-quality implementation of the core question/answer/ranking interaction is complete, and we'll beginning work on delegation in the coming months.

Please hop in and [join the conversation](https://hyperarchy.com). We'd love to hear your thoughts about how technology can bring about a fairer, more personal, and efficient form of government. We'll keep working and keep you posted. Please spread the word.

Thanks,<br/>
