write relates to one in terms of a "limit" relation which limits the size of its result set to 1
relates to 1 generates a #{relation_name}_relation method that gives direct access to its limit relation object
has many, et al
attributes can't have the same name as class methods on Tuple or they shadow them... how can this be circumvented?
  either disallow attributes with those names
  alias the existing methods to something else (could break other code)
  change the api

wire representations of attributes ultimately need to be evaluated in the context of a subdomain, because users might refer
to forbidden attributes that are projected away. but right now its useless for them to refer to an attribute of a set they
can't see, so we can use the global sets for resolving attributes
